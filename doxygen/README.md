# VCS's Doxygen documentation
VCS comes with partial, work-in-progress documentation in the Doxygen format.

To build the documentation, issue the following terminal command:

```
$ doxygen doxygen.cfg
```

The above command assumes you've:
- installed Doxygen
- cloned the full VCS repository
- navigated to the `doxygen` directory of the VCS repository

The built docs will be placed under the `html` subdirectory.

In the future, pre-built docs will be available online.
