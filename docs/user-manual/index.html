                <dokki-topic title="System requirements">

                    <p>VCS runs mainly on the CPU and in one thread, so it's most important to have a processor
                    with strong single-core performance. An Intel Haswell or equivalent should be fine.</p>

                    <p>VCS uses roughly 1 GB of RAM.</p>

                    <p>When rendering with OpenGL (optional), an OpenGL 1.2 compatible video card is required.</p>

                </dokki-topic>

                <dokki-topic title="Getting started">
                    
                    <p>Assuming you've installed the drivers for your capture device, as well as unpacked the
                    binary distribution of VCS (linked to, above) into a folder, getting VCS going is simply
                    a matter of running its vcs.exe executable.</p>

                    <p>When you run the executable, two windows will open: a console window, in which notifications
                    about VCS's status will appear during operation; and the output window, in which captured
                    frames are displayed.</p>

                    <dokki-tip>
                        <p>You can launch <em>vcs.exe</em> with command-line parameters to automate certain start-up
                        tasks. A list of the command-line options is given in the command-line section.</p>
                    </dokki-tip>

                    <p>If this is your first time running VCS, the first thing you may want to do is adjust
                    the capture video parameters (phase, position, colors, etc.). They can be set up via the
                    <a href="#dialogs-video-presets">Video presets</a> dialog.</p>

                    <p>The central point of the VCS user interface is the output window, where captured frames are
                    displayed as they arrive from the capture device and having undergone any of VCS's filtering
                    and scaling.</p>

                            <p>Although you can emulate a fullscreen mode by turning off the output window's border (see <a href="#output-window-borderless-mode">Borderless mode</a>) and then scaling the window to the size of the the display area (see <a href="#output-window-resizing">Resizing</a>), there's also a true fullscreen mode available. You can toggle it on/off with the F11 shortcut key.</p>

                            <dokki-tip>For the fullscreen mode to work best, you may first need to manually resize the output window to match the resolution of your screen (see <a href="#output-window-resizing">Resizing</a>).</dokki-tip>

                            <p>The output window's title bar shows information about VCS's current operating state; e.g. the input and output resolution.</p>

                            <p>Under special circumstances, the title bar may also show one of these messages:</p>

                            <ul>
                            <li><em>VCS - No signal</em> The capture device doesn't appear to be receiving a signal.</li>
                            <li><em>VCS - Signal out of range</em> Either VCS or the capture device is unable to process the current video mode. For VCS, the maximum capture resolution is 1920 &times; 1080.</li>

                                    Set the color depth with which frames are captured. This is a hardware-level setting: the capture device will convert each frame to this color depth before uploading it to system memory - thus lower color depths consume less bandwidth. Prior to display, VCS will convert the frames to the color depth of the <a href="#output-window">output window</a>.

                                    Set the de-interlacing mode for interlaced signals. This is a hardware-level setting. Will have no effect on non-interlaced signals (even if the captured frames exhibit interlacing).

                        <p>The video recorder gives you the option to stream captured frames into a video file.</p>
                        
                        <p>To use the video recorder in Windows, you'll need to install the 32-bit version of the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/x264vfw/files/x264vfw/44_2851bm_44825/">x264vfw</a> codec and run its configurator at least once, so that its settings are added into the Windows registry for VCS to find.</p>
                        
                        <p>The recorder will write frames as they appear in the <a href="#output-window">output window</a> into a video file, with the following caveats:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Audio won't be recorded.</li>
                            <li>Frames will be inserted into the video at the rate of capture; the recorder doesn't try to maintain any particular frame rate (e.g. by duplicating or dropping frames). For example, if your capture source is 57.5 Hz, one minute of video will have 57.5 * 60 frames, and if that video is played back at 60 FPS, it will appear slightly sped up.</li>
                            <li>If VCS drops any frames during recording (e.g. due to insufficient system performance), the video's playback will be non-linear. So if you're recording a separate audio file and are planning to sync it with the video, you want there to be no frames dropped while recording the video.</li>
                            <li>The video will be recorded in the H.264 format using an x264 codec.</li>
                            <li>The video resolution will be that of the current output size (see <a href="#dialogs-output-resolution">Output resolution dialog</a>).</li>
                            <li>The output size can't be changed while recording; all frames will be scaled automatically to fit the current size.</li>
                            <li>The <a href="#dialogs-overlay">overlay</a> won't be recorded.</li>
                            <li>Encoder parameters influencing image quality (e.g. CRF) can't be customized in the Linux version of VCS. This is a limitation of OpenCV. You can, however, modify and recompile the OpenCV code with higher-quality default options (see e.g. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is_it_possible_to_set_the_lossfree_option_for_the_X264_codec_in_OpenCV">here</a>).</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p><em>Nominal FPS</em> The video's suggested playback rate. This setting doesn't affect the recording rate, only the rate at which the video might be played back by your video player. The actual recording FPS will be determined by the capture source's refresh rate.</p>

                            <p><em>Additional x264 arguments</em> You put down in this field any custom x264 command-line arguments.</p>

                            <p>For best image quality regardless of performance and/or file size, you can try the following settings:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li><em>Profile</em>: <em>High 4:4:4</em></li>
                                <li><em>Pixel format</em>: <em>RGB</em></li>
                                <li><em>CRF</em>: <em>0</em></li>
                                <li><em>Preset</em>: <em>Ultrafast</em></li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>To reduce file size while maintaining high image quality, you can set <em>Preset</em> to "Veryfast" or "Faster" and increase <em>CRF</em> to 10-15. For more tips and tricks, you can look up documentation specific to the x264 encoder.</p>

                            <p>If the recorder dialog indicates that frames are being dropped while recording, try to select recording options that require less CPU or IO performance.
                            - Dragging or otherwise interacting with GUI items (e.g. dialog windows) during recording may cause transient frame drops.
                            - During recording, frames will be saved to disk in batches. If you get a bunch of frames dropped every couple of seconds but no drops otherwise, insufficient disk performance may be the reason (i.e. writing the batch of frames takes too long).</p>

                        <p>Under some circumstances, like when the captured source doesn't sync its rendering with the refresh rate, captured frames can contain tearing. VCS's anti-tearer helps mitigate this issue.</p>

                        <p>Anti-tearing should be considered an experimental feature of VCS. It works well in some cases and not that well in others. It'll completely fail to work if the captured source redraws the screen at a rate higher than the capture's refresh rate - e.g. a game running at 100 FPS with a refresh of 60 Hz.</p>

                        <dokki-item title="Settings">
                            <p><em>Scan start</em> Set where the anti-tearer begins scanning each frame for tears. Static screen-wide content like a game's UI bar can prevent the anti-tearing from working, so you should set this value so that such content is excluded. You can choose to visualize the scan range to help you set it up.</p>

                            <p><em>Scan end</em> Same as <em>Scan start</em> but for where the scanning should end. This is an offset from the bottom of the screen up, so e.g. a value of 5 at a resolution of 640 &times; 480 would mean the scanning ends at pixel row 475.</p>

                            <p><em>Scan direction</em> If the captured source redraws its screen from bottom to top, set the scan direction to <em>Down</em>. Otherwise, use the <em>Up</em> setting. Using the wrong direction will fully prevent the anti-tearing from working (it may correctly detect tears but won't be able to remove them).</p>

                            <p><em>Scan hint</em> If the captured source redraws its screen at a rate higher than half of its refresh rate but lower than the full refresh rate (e.g. 35 FPS at 60 Hz), you may (or might not) have better results and/or performance by setting this option to <em>Look for one tear per frame</em>. Otherwise, use the <em>Look for multiple tears per frame</em> setting.</p>

                            <p><em>Visualization</em> Draw certain anti-tearing-related markers in the <a href="#output-window">output window</a>.</p>

                            <p><em>Threshold</em> The anti-tearer compares adjacent frames to find which parts of the new frame may be torn (where pixels from the previous frame are still visible). This setting controls the amount by which a pixel's color values are allowed to change between frames without the pixel being considered new (given inherent noise in analog pixels). In an ideal situation where there's no noise in the captured signal, you can set this to 0 or close to it. Otherwise, the value should be high enough to exclude capture noise.</p>

                            <p><em>Window size</em> When scanning frames for tears, the anti-tearer will average together a bunch of horizontal pixels' color values to reduce the negative effect of analog noise. This setting controls the pixel size of the sampling window. Lower values will result in better performance but possibly worse tear detection.</p>

                            <p><em>Step size</em> The number of pixels to skip horizontally when scanning for tears. Higher values will improve performance but may cause a failure to detect subtler tears.</p>

                            <p><em>Matches req'd</em> Set how many times the sampling window must find a pixel's color values to have exceeded the detection threshold for a horizontal row of pixels to be considered new relative to the previous frame. Higher values should reduce the chance of false positives but may also cause a failure to detect subtler tears.</p>

                        <p>The filter graph is made up of nodes that can be connected together in a chain. These nodes come in three varieties: <em>input gate</em>, <em>output gate</em>, and <em>filter</em>.</p>

                        <p>The input and output gates determine the resolutions for which the connected filters will be applied. For instance, if you set an input gate's width and height to 640 and 480, and the width and height of an output gate to 1920 and 1080, any filters you connect between these two nodes will be applied when the size of the output window is 1920 &times; 1080 and the original resolution of the frames (i.e. the capture resolution) is 640 &times; 480. You can also use the value 0 for a gate's width and/or height to allow VCS to match any value to that dimension: an input gate with a width and height of 0, for instance, will apply the connected filters to frames of all capture resolutions, provided that they also meet the resolution specified for the output gate. A filter graph can have multiple chains of these input-filter-output combos, and VCS will select the most suitable one (or none) given the current capture and output resolutions.</p>

                        <dokki-tip>
                            When deciding which of multiple filter chains to use, VCS will prefer more specific chains to more general ones. If you have e.g. an input gate whose width and height are 0, and another input gate whose width and height are 640 and 480, the latter will be used when the capture resolution is exactly 640 &times; 480, and the former otherwise. Likewise, if your input gates are 0 &times; 0 and 640 &times; 0, the former will be applied for capture resolutions of <em>any</em> x <em>any</em>, except for 640 &times; <em>any</em>, where the latter chain will apply - except if you also have a third input gate of 640 &times; 480, in which case that will be used when the capture resolution is exactly 640 &times; 480.
                        </dokki-tip>

                        <p>To connect two nodes, click and drag with the left mouse button from one node's output edge (square) to another's input edge (circle), or vice versa. A node can be connected to as many other nodes as you like. To disconnect a node from another, right-click on the node's output edge, and select the other node from the list that pops up. To remove a node itself from the graph, right-click on the node and select to remove it. To add nodes to the graph, select <em>Add</em> from the dialog's menu bar.</p>

                    <p>Optionally, you can pass one or more of following command-line arguments when launching VCS:</p>

                    <p><em>-i &lt;input channel&gt;</em> Start capture on the given input channel (1&#8230;<i>n</i>). On Linux, a value of 1 corresponds to /dev/video0, 2 to /dev/video1, 3 to /dev/video2, etc. By default, channel #1 will be used.</p>

                    <p><em>-v &lt;path + filename&gt;</em> Load video presets from the given file on start-up. Video preset files typically have the .vcs-video suffix.</p>

                    <p><em>-f &lt;path + filename&gt;</em> Load a custom filter graph from the given file on start-up. Filter graph files typically have the .vcs-filter-graph suffix.</p>

                    <p><em>-a &lt;path + filename&gt;</em> Load alias resolutions from the given file on start-up. Alias resolution files typically have the .vcs-alias suffix.</p>

                    <p><em>-m &lt;value in MB&gt;</em> Set the amount of system memory that VCS reserves on startup. If you're getting error messages about the memory cache running out, increase this value. If you get x264 allocation errors when attempting to record video, try reducing this value. Default: 256 MB.</p>

                    <p>For example, if you had capture parameters stored in the file <em>params.vcsm</em>, and you wanted capture to start on input channel #2 when you run VCS, you might launch VCS like so:
                    <em>
                    vcs.exe -v "params.vcs-video" -i 2
                    </em></p>
